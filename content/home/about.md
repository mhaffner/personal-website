# Biography

I'm currently a PhD Candidate in the Department of Geography at Oklahoma State
University. I'm also a Graduate Research Assistant, working with the Oklahoma
Historical Society. Outside of my research interests, I have a passion for
Emacs/Spacemacs, GNU/Linux, Free Software, music, Oklahoma State sports, and
commuter cycling. These do inevitably spill into research in various ways, of
course! Check out my CV [here](https://mhaffner.github.io/cv/cv.pdf).
