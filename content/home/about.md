# Biography

I'm currently an Assitant Professor in the Department of Geography and
Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire where I started in
June 2018. Most of my research revolves around geographic information science
(GIScience), though I'm also interested in Emacs, GNU/Linux, Free/Libre
Software, commuter cycling, and most recently, landscape photography. These do
spill into research in various ways, of course!
