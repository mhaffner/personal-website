abstract = "Location-based social media (LBSM), a specific type of volunteered geographic information (VGI), is increasingly being used as a spatial data source for researchers in geography and related disciplines. Many questions, though, have been raised about VGI data
in terms of its quality and its contributors. While a number of studies have
explored users' demographics and motivations for contribution to explicitly
geographic forms of VGI, such as OpenStreetMap and Wikimapia, few have focused
on these aspects with implicitly geographic forms of VGI, such as LBSM (for
example, Twitter and Instagram). This study, through use of an online survey,
specifically assesses the LBSM behavior and perceptions of 253 university
students, noting differences found in gender, race, and academic standing. We
find that the greatest differences are those between males and females, rather
than through race or academic standing, and LBSM appears less biased than other
forms of VGI."
