I'm currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and
Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire where I started in
June 2018. Most of my research revolves around geographic information science
(GIScience), but I'm also interested in Emacs, GNU/Linux, Free/Libre Software,
commuter cycling, and most recently, landscape photography. These do spill into
research in various ways, of course!
