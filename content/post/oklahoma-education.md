I decided this post was necessary as a means to vent my frustration over the
poor arguments I'm hearing surrounding the Oklahoma teachers' walkout. Most of
these conversations devolve into arguments about what teachers "deserve" or
don't deserve or claims that teachers don't work hard enough for a pay increase
or that they are overworked. I think empirical analyses are useful and often
necessary<sup>1</sup>, but I'm not incredibly interested in these here. That's
mostly because the discourse around the teachers' walkout reflects a _set of
values_, and without understanding these, endless back and forth bickering is
not productive.

The title of this post somewhat pains me since several my family and friends are
teachers (both in Oklahoma and other states). All of the teachers I know are
excellent at what they do, and I'm not trying to belittle their profession.
Maybe the title is overly exaggerated click-bait but that's okay. When I say
that I don't care about Oklahoma teachers, I don't mean this to be taken
literally. What I mean is that I don't care about Oklahoma teachers any more
than I care about factory workers, dietitians, engineers, professors, or anyone
else, so of course I care about teachers at a fundamental level. Yes, I want
everyone to make a living wage, perhaps to a fault. Though it certainly could be
argued that a teachers' starting salary in Oklahoma is not reasonable, that
point detracts from my message. More important than caring about the teachers is
caring about the *kids*, the *value of public education*, and the *opportunity
for upward mobility*. That's what this argument should focus on. I don't want
people to just care about their own kids - I want people to care about poor
rural kids in the Panhandle, kids from immigrant families in Oklahoma City, kids
from rough neighborhoods in Tulsa - EVERYONE. 

People often draw on off-hand anecdotes that are so abstract that I can't
believe they actually rely on them. Tackling these in everyday conversation is
difficult, so I'll provide some commentary on a few of them here while trying to
stay in line with the main message (plus a few digressions).

Let's let _x_ be nursing, since that's the specific example I've heard recently.
To that point I would ask this: should programmers in Silicon Valley be making
$200/hr.? Many of them are working to figure out how to make people click more
ads - _which makes people's life worse_ - should they make more than nurses? Of
course it is foolish to debate what people "deserve" in various private sector
industries since these are completely market-driven, and it's equally foolish to
compare what public sector employees deserve compared to private sector
employees<sup>2</sup>. Teachers' pay shouldn't be valued/devalued based upon the
going rate in other professions. Their pay should be determined by what it costs
to _obtain and retain_ high quality employees within that profession. If
everyone hires programmers at $200/hr., and your company chooses to pay them at
$190/hr., you will certainly have the worse programmers unless you can offer
something that can't be quantified.

This is where the lack of American geographical literacy shines bright.

I want that teacher fired. Fire her. Increase the pay of the position by
$10,000, and hire someone better.

But on a more serious note - what incentive do teachers have to be excellent at
what they do in this state? It's difficult to recruit teachers in many Oklahoma
school districts. Excellent teachers should be rewarded - _not because they
deserve it_ but because if they're not _they will go somewhere else_: another
school, another school in another state, or another industry.

The state should figure it out.

Again, the state should figure it out. What do we value? Low taxes or a good
education system? Of course, everyone knows it is the former, but at least this
drives at the

I could conduct a rigorous, comparative empirical analysis on the cost of living
versus teachers'

I'll provide a few anecdotes of my own. These are real situations; I just
preserve anonymity by not mentioning names:

It's hard to imagine a person would have the motivation to stay in the business
for long after making $30,000/yr. doing the same thing previously.

I can't speak for her, but if I had to guess I'd say the chances are not great
as the incentives are too low, and this is massive blow for the school. We need
teachers with different life experiences Similarly, Oklahoma State attracts many
students from outside the state, particularly Texas.
