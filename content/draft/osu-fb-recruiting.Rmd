# Introduction
Anyone who reads listens to Gundy's press conferences around signing day or
reads PFB articles on recruiting knows that Oklahoma State Football's recruiting
practices are heavily scrutinized. The writers of PFB have pointed out that
Gundy's attitude toward recruiting has seemingly changed. Where the mantra used
to be "recruiting is the most important thing we do," it now seems less
important. With his recent contract extension and seemingly nonchalant attitude
toward the disappointing results of the 2018 season, some have accused Gundy of
becoming complacent, particularly in the area of recruiting. Though Oklahoma
State has historically overperformed based on its recruiting class rankings, the
ceiling is capped with lackluster recruiting classes. As a geographer, I
naturally wonder how the locational aspects of Oklahoma State's recruiting
practices have changed over time, and that's what I'll be discussing in this
piece.

Rather than making a prediction beforehand about how changes have occurred,
(e.g., Gundy has become less effective in recruiting within the region, or, on
the other hand, the geographic variability has lessened over time) my approach
is more exploratory. I'm simply looking for an observable inflection point -- or
consistent changes over time -- that help explain *how* Gundy's recruiting
practices have changed with his apparent change in attitude.

Before I begin, I must make a few disclaimers. First, a change in the spatial
practices of OSU recruits does not mean lower quality athletes, and my approach
does not consider recruits' rankings. Few people would complain if OSU *only*
signed players from Texas... if those players *all* happened to be the top
20-ish in the state, or if OSU landed zero players within a 500 miles radius of
Stillwater but received all four and five star recruits from California,
Washington, New York, and Florida. Additionally, recruiting isn't all on Gundy -
it's a group effort among all coaches, and assistants can have considerable
influence in where players sign (e.g., consider Marcus Arroyo's influence).

That said, recruiting starts with the head coach, and caveats aside, geography
clearly matters. Virtually every university signs more recruits from near than
far, and Oklahoma State faces considerably different recruiting challenges than
other similarly sized schools in other parts of the country (e.g., Washington
State, Clemson, or Boise State). Conference alignment matters, as do the
locations of other schools in the conference, recruits' distance from family and
friends, the weather, culture, or other personal factors related to location. My
colleagues who are Nebraska alums bemoan the Huskers' de-emphasis on local
recruiting that began in the early 2000s -- which some blame for Nebraska's
downfall -- and it's hard to ignore the coincident struggles that Nebraska,
Missouri, and Colorado have faced since leaving the Big XII.

The spatialities of recruiting have mostly been beaten like a dead horse in the
world of sports geography, so I wanted to do something a bit unconventional by
exploring more than just the locations of where recruits come from. In this
piece investigate (1) change by year over Gundy's entire tenure, (2) measures of
central spatial tendency like the mean and median center, (3) a measure of
dispersion (i.e. standard deviation of distance from Stillwater), and (4)
interactive visualizations through web maps. For all analyses and visualization
I use the R Project for Statistical Computing, and I retrieved data on Oklahoma
State's recruits from Rivals.com. If you're interested in the technical aspects
or source code, you can read about them
[here](mhaffner.github.io/posts/osu-fb-recruiting-tech.html).

# All recruits
First, I map the hometowns (or in the case of transfers, previous
locations) of all signees recruited during Gundy's tenure, with 2005 excluded
since the players during this year were not his recruits.

<div style="text-align: center;">
### Recruits' hometowns (2006 - 2019)
</div>
```{r, code = readLines("/home/matt/git-repos/okstate-fb-recruiting/scripts/map-all-recruits.R"), echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
```

The majority of recruits outside of Oklahoma come from Texas (no surprise),
particularly Dallas, Houston, and the eastern half of the state in general. One
one hand this appears to be simply an artifact of proximity to major population
centers (i.e. Dallas and Houston), yet there appears to be a disproportionate
number of recruits from Texas (and Kansas) compared to Arkansas or Missouri.
Outside of Oklahoma's bordering states, several small clusters can be seen near
Atlanta, southern Louisiana and Mississippi, and southern California.

# Central tendency and dispersion
The field of spatial statistics exists in part because humans are notoriously
bad at recognizing spatial patterns. Though this web map is fun to play with and
displays general distributions, it doesn't tell us anything definitive about
patterns over time. Rather than just eyeballing recruits locations year-to-year,
I assess trends using two measures of central tendency for spatial data -- the
mean and median center -- and a measure of dispersion: standard deviation of
distance from Stillwater.
 
Mean and median centers are calculated as one would expect, except utilizing two
dimensions (latitude and longitude) instead of one. Rather than comparing these
separately, I think they are useful to view together. Medians reduce the
influence of outliers, which in this case are introduced by intermittent
recruits from California, the Northeast, and Canada. Chuba Hubbard's hometown,
for example, lies at a whopping **53.5 degrees north**. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
### Mean centers of recruits' hometowns (2006 - 2019)
</div>
```{r, code = readLines("/home/matt/git-repos/okstate-fb-recruiting/scripts/map-mean-centers.R"), echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
```

<div style="text-align: center;">
### Median centers of recruits' hometowns (2006 - 2019)
</div>
```{r, code = readLines("/home/matt/git-repos/okstate-fb-recruiting/scripts/map-median-centers.R"), echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
```
In many cases --
especially when underlying distributions are not assessed first -- the median is
a more appropriate measure, yet both measures yield similar results in this case. The
median center does reduce the amount of east-west
variability, however, and makes 2009 and 2016 stand out from the other years.  Aside from
these years, the centers appear to remain remarkably stable, including recent
years (2017 - 2019), with no apparent systematic change over time.

It's hard to ignore that many of the 2009 recruits played for the historic 2011
team two years later, yet the results two years following 2016 (i.e. 2018) were
quite disparate. It would be nice to be able tie individual recruiting classes
to performance in the years following, but I don't think it works way. Unlike
basketball in which one superb recruiting class can drastically alter a team's
trajectory, football is different. Success is made out of pattern of high
caliber recruiting over long period of time.

# Dispersion
While informative, these measures do not consider dispersion or within-year
variability. For example, if Oklahoma State received all of its recruits from
Dallas during one year and zero recruits from Dallas during another year, the
two years *could* still have the exact same mean or median center (that said,
2009 and 2016 have similarly dispersed patterns compared to other years). Next,
I create a plot showing the distance and direction of each recruit's hometown to
Stillwater by year.

<div style="text-align: center;">
### Distance and direction of recruits' hometowns to Stillwater
</div>
```{r, code = readLines("/home/matt/git-repos/okstate-fb-recruiting/scripts/plot-lines.R"), echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
```

This plot displays some intriguing patterns. In each of the years 2007, 2010,
and 2011 Oklahoma State signed *only one player* from north of Stillwater (2015
appears this way too, but actually two signees came from El Dorado, KS),
emphasizing the importance of Texas -- and other parts of the southern US -- to
its recruiting efforts. Next, I create a plot comparing mean, median, and
standard deviation of distance from Stillwater.

<div style="text-align: center;">
### Mean, median, and standard deviation of recruits' distance from Stillwater
</div>
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://gitlab.com/mhaffner/okstate-fb-recruiting/raw/master/img/summary.png")
```

Again, no systematic trends appear, although the median distance from Stillwater
is less in 2016 - 2019 than any previous years. That said, standard deviation is
not less during these years; in fact, 2017 has the greatest standard deviation
in the dataset (largely thanks to Chuba Hubbard).

# Conclusion
So what does all of this mean? I think the most straightforward takeaway is that
the geography of Oklahoma State's recruiting practices has remained fairly
stable over Gundy's tenure. If Gundy has become complacent, it's not appearing
in locational distributions of recruits. That said, recruiting efforts could
certainly be improved, and there is one glaringly relevant takeaway to the
future of Oklahoma State football: the array of locations from which players
come is *good enough* in the sense that there are plenty of sufficiently
talented players in those places. The challenge is recruiting *better* players
from those locations. As mentioned earlier, this study did not consider
recruits' high school (or JUCO) ratings.

While it is a bit disappointing to not find something juicier, there are several
logical ways this small project could be extended. First and foremost, the
effect of distance on the *quality* of recruits may be revealing. For example,
are signees from farther away rated lower those close to Stillwater? If so, this
may give *some* credence to the idea that "it's difficult to get players to come
to Stillwater" or, more precisely, that "Oklahoma State is less successful is
getting good players from far away to come to Stillwater." Of course, this
assumes current conditions with the present efforts and strategies put into
recruiting. On the flip side, if results were insignificant in that distance
does not have an effect on the quality of recruits, perhaps Oklahoma State could
be more aggressive -- and confident -- in offering higher rated recruits from
farther away. These effects could be assessed with a simple correlation
analysis.

What could be even more informative, however, is a comparative study with
another similar university -- either one in the Big XII, similarly positioned
regionally[^1], or a comparatively sized university in another part of the
country. With the [recent comparisons of Oklahoma State to
Clemson](https://pistolsfiringblog.com/reader-thoughts-what-does-an-oklahoma-state-clemson-comp-look-like/),
a side-by-side comparison of Oklahoma State's geography of recruiting to this
year's NCAA national champions may make for a fascinating study.

If you catch something that I didn't see in the data or if you have another idea
for a follow-up study, feel free to point it out in the comments!
